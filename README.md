# Reimaging-Lab
# Objective:
Reimage an old HP laptop from Windows 10 OS to Ubuntu OS. 

## Description

In this lab, I will be reimaging a laptop that cannot be logged into. The laptop was originally running Windows 10, I will be reimaging to an Ubuntu operating system. The purpose of this lab is to familiarize yourself with the process of reimaging no matter the type of OS that you are using. I picked Ubuntu as the laptop is very old and is better suited for it. 


I first downloaded Rufus (bootable USB creation) to be able to create a bootable USB and selecting Ubuntu as the operating system.

The computer restarted from the USB with the Ubuntu OS and will be installed to replace the old Windows OS.
