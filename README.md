# Reimaging-Lab
Reimaging an old HP laptop from Windows 10 OS to Ubuntu OS. 

## Description

In this lab, I will be reimaging a laptop. The laptop is originally running Windows 10, I will be reimaging to an Ubuntu OS. The purpose of this lab is to familiarize yourself with the process of reimaging no matter the type of OS that you are using. I picked Ubuntu as the laptop is very old and is more suited for it. 


I first downloaded "Rufus" to be able to create a bootable USB and making sure to select the Ubuntu OS.

On the laptop, I restarted and started pressing 'esc' to enter the startup menu. Where I pressed F9 to enter 'Boot Device Options' Once in the boot menu I selected the option for 'USB Hard Drive'

The computer restarted from the USB with the Ubuntu OS and will be installed to replace the old Windows OS.
